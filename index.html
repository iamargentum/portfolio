            <p>hi!</p>
            <p>i am <span id="boldest">rajat</span></p>
            <p>i am a full stack developer with <span id="boldest">almost</span> <span id="bolder">2YoE</span> (wow! <span id="bolderThanBolder">almost</span> so much experience!)</p>
            <p>i like <span id="bolder">coding</span>, <span id="bolder">music</span>, <span id="bolder">cycling</span> and <span id="bolder">juggling</span></p>
            <p>this is my <span id="boldest">"stuff up everything i know, everything i've worked on"</span> website and is under construction</p>
            <p>i feel like it will be more interesting once completely built</p>
            <p>wow! those are a lot of sentences that start with <span id="bolder">"i"</span></p>
            <p>this website is an eyesore to look at :(</p>
            <p>but it will be much better <span id="boldest">very soon!</span></p>
